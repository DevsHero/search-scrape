# Test Reports Index (v1.0.0)

This folder contains production-readiness artifacts and how to reproduce them.

## Primary artifact (recommended)

- `RELEASE_READINESS_2026-02-12.json`
  - Generated by `run_release_validation.py`
  - Contains:
    - `/health` and `/mcp/tools` checks
    - Per-tool “call” cases with latency and content previews
    - Tool count validation (8 tools)

## How to reproduce

### 1) Unit + integration tests (Rust)

```bash
cd mcp-server
cargo test
cargo test --release
```

Notes:
- Some high-friction “boss/god” tests are intentionally `#[ignore]`.

### 2) End-to-end release validation (HTTP surface)

Start the Docker stack first (recommended):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up -d --build
```

Then run the validation harness:

```bash
python3 docs/run_release_validation.py
```

This writes/updates `docs/RELEASE_READINESS_2026-02-12.json` (timestamped inside).
